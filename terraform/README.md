# Terraform

[Terraform][terraform] is a declarative Infrastructure as Code tool to provision
resources in cloud environments.

We use [Terraform Cloud][terraform-cloud] to store the state between runs and to
execute the runs. You don't need to install anything locally to contribute,
although it may help in your debugging process.
